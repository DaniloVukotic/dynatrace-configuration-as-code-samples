# Dynatrace Configuration as Code Samples

This repository collects sample projects for the Dynatrace Configuration as Code tool Monaco.

## Getting Started with Dynatrace Configuration as Code

To get started with Dynatrace Configuration as Code please see [the documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/monitoring-as-code).

To download the CLI, head over to the [dynatrace-configuration-as-code GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-configuration-as-code/releases).

## Other forms of Dynatrace Configuration as Code

In addition to our official Configuration as Code tool Monaco there is also a [Dynatrace Terraform provider](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/terraform-provider-dynatrace).

**Please note that unlike Monaco there is no official support provided for the Terraform provider.**

Unless you are already strongly invested in using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code we recommend using Monaco for Dynatrace configuration as code.
